        <h1>My Travel Style</h1>
        <p>As a travel blogger, I get invited to press trips regularly with a set itinerary; but after that’s done with, I would often extend my stay in order to explore the destination at my own pace. If I’m not working, however, I usually stay in a new city for at least 2 weeks (sometimes, for at least a month). Afterward, I would write travel guides and itineraries that are based on my experiences as well as the facts that I have researched.</p>
